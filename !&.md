title: The !& community
subtitle: A space for independent consultants

The !& (pronounced: Yes! And...) community is three things:

- A space for independent consultants to learn and grow
- Regular salon discussions to explore the world of indie consulting

My core ambitions with the space:

- Create a weird space. Embrace the uniqueness of independent workers.
- Open people up to new ways of thinking and seeing and doing.

I've removed the open invite link to prevent the space growing too quickly. But if you identify as an independent consultant and want an invite DM me or email me.
