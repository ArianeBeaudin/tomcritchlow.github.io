I recently read the book [Impro - Improvisation and the Theatre](https://www.amazon.com/Impro-Improvisation-Theatre-Keith-Johnstone/dp/0878301178) by Keith Johnstone. It's a delightful book all about improvisational theatre and importantly *how to teach* improvisational theatre.

![](/images/Impro-by-Keith-Johnstone.jpg) I loved the book and as Venkatesh said *'it is a textbook that teaches you how to see the world differently.'* so consider it recommended.

The book inspired me to draw many analogies between the improv actor and the consultant and I have written a five part series. They loosely flow in order but each can be read in any order:

**[Chapter 1 - The Office is a Theatre for Work](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/11/18/yes-and/)**. This post looks at the central problem of "performing" work and how important it is for modern knowledge work - especially for the consultant. We end with some ideas around how to think on your feet without bullshitting.

**[Chapter 2 - Optimism as an Operating System](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/11/19/optimism-operating-system/)**. This post highlights the tendency for consultants to be critical and to see everything as a problem. We'll reframe this by showing the power of being positive - especially for long-term retainers.

**[Chapter 3 - Blocking & Unblocking Clients](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/12/06/blocking-unblocking-clients/)**. Here we think of clients as blocked actors and we take inspiration from the "Yes! and..." exercise to see how we can unblock clients to generate new strategies and creative thinking with clients.

**[Chapter 4 - Navigating Power & Status](https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/06/24/navigating-power-status/)**. How to get things done inside organizations by understanding power potholes and status switching. We explore the concept of high status and low status and show how the consultant has to become adept at a new skill of "status switching" in order to be successful inside client organizations.

**[Chapter 5 - The Contrary Consultant](https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/08/18/the-fool/)**. Embracing the fool & the power of not fitting in. We explore the identity of outsider and how to reconcile this with working inside client organizations.
